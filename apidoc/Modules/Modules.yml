    Modules in this section are optional modules that may be packaged with the Titanium SDK.
    These modules are not part of the Titanium namespace, and must be added to the `tiapp.xml`
    file and imported using [require](Global.require).

    Each of the modules in this section is either packaged with the Titanium SDK or
    available for free through the [Appcelerator Marketplace](https://marketplace.appcelerator.com).
